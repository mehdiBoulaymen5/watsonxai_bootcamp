We will use the PrompTemplate class to simplify creation of our few shot prompts for XYZ Retail.\n\nXYZ Retail has provided you their customer's data in .csv format. To generate prompts for each customer, you will need to transform the prompt that you engineered in Prompt Builder into a more useful programmatic format. Using the PromptTemplate class, you can easily substitute customer data to generate one or multiple prompts.\n\nThe PromptTemplate class defines a schema where variables to replace are placed inside curly braces \"{}\". In Python parlance, it's simply using \"f-strings\" under the hood.
